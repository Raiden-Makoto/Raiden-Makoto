## Things I Made:
- [WheresMyBus](https://wheresmybus.vercel.app/): A full-stack transit tracking platform that processes live GTFS-RT telemetry and service advisories, transforming raw transit data into sub-second, actionable insights for TTC users.
- [ErasLang IDE](https://eras-lang-ide.vercel.app/): A Taylor Swift-themed esoteric language mapping lyrics to low-level integer logic, with its own IDE and compiler
- [BroteinShake BioHub](https://42cummer-broteinshake.hf.space/): A Dockerized protein design platform bridging the gap between generative sequence design (ProteinMPNN) and structural validation (ESMFold).
- [VFV.TO Quantum Market Monitor](https://42cummer-quantummarketmonitor.hf.space/): Real-Time Quantum Risk Monitor for S&P 500 ETF. Unlike traditional indicators that rely on past averages (SMA, RSI), this project uses a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (QWGAN) to simulate 200 possible future price (+15 minutes) trajectories in real-time, visualizing the market's "probability cloud" to detect trends and anomalies. AI prediction mays not always be accurate. **Use at own risk.**
- [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Diffusion for Molecular Generation](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/QuantumEDM): This project demonstrates Quantum Advantage in Model Expressivity for geometric machine learning tasks. I built a custom diffusion pipeline from scratch to benchmark a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture against an equivalently constrained Classical Baseline. The Hybrid Quantum model outperformed the classical baseline in accuracy by 4.5% (MSE 0.2087 vs 0.2185).
- [QwenMPS](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/QwenMPS): A custom, from-scratch Large Language Model inference engine optimized for Apple Silicon, featuring high-performance 4-bit quantization kernels written in raw Metal Shading Language (MSL). [IN PROGRESS]
- [MCCatMod](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/MCCatMod): A Minecraft mod that gives increased utility to cats! Cats are now able to heal passively, wear cat armor, catch fish and rabbits, and play with each other. Different cat variants also provide different buffs!
