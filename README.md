## Things I Made:
- [WheresMyBus](https://wheresmybus.vercel.app/): A full-stack transit tracking platform that processes live GTFS-RT telemetry and service advisories, transforming raw transit data into sub-second, actionable insights for TTC users.
- [ErasLang IDE](https://eras-lang-ide.vercel.app/): A Taylor Swift-themed esoteric language mapping lyrics to low-level integer logic, with its own IDE and compiler
- [BroteinShake BioHub](https://42cummer-broteinshake.hf.space/): A Dockerized protein design platform bridging the gap between generative sequence design (ProteinMPNN) and structural validation (ESMFold).
- [VFV.TO Quantum Market Monitor](https://42cummer-quantummarketmonitor.hf.space/): Real-Time Quantum Risk Monitor for S&P 500 ETF. Unlike traditional indicators that rely on past averages (SMA, RSI), this project uses a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (QWGAN) to simulate 200 possible future price (+15 minutes) trajectories in real-time, visualizing the market's "probability cloud" to detect trends and anomalies. AI prediction mays not always be accurate. **Use at own risk.**
- [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Diffusion for Molecular Generation](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/QuantumEDM/tree/main): This project demonstrates Quantum Advantage in Model Expressivity for geometric machine learning tasks. I built a custom diffusion pipeline from scratch to benchmark a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture against an equivalently constrained Classical Baseline. The Hybrid Quantum model outperformed the classical baseline in accuracy by 4.5% (MSE 0.2087 vs 0.2185).
