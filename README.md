### About Me  
The M in "Makoto" stands for  **Machine Learning**. Fun fact: I led a group of high schoolers in developing a Quantum Graph Generative Adversarial Neural Network for molecular synthesis as part of Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program. Somehow we cooked and accomplished:
- Technical Paper Talk @ IEEE Quantum Week (Sep 2024 @ Montreal, QC)
- Poster Presentation @ IEEE Quantum Week (Sep 2024 @ Bellevue, WA)
- Poster Presentation @ West Coast Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference (Apr 2023 @ LMU)

### Publications
- Quantum Week 2023 Proceeding available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313850)

### Current Project(s)
1. [TTC Bus Tracker](https://wheresmybus.vercel.app): View real-time TTC Bus Arrivals, stop information, and more
2. [SoundofMusic](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/SoundOfMusic): A complete ML pipeline for generating song + lyrics in the style of the goat Taylor Swift
3. [510 Spadina](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/510Spadina): Temporary repository while I update Genshinfy to use Stable Diffusion and more recent improved image gen models.

  
### Completed/Past Project(s)
- Quantum Graph Generative Adversarial Neural Network [here](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/QWGraphGAN-GP)
- Entropy-based [Wordle Solver](https://42cummer-entropywordlesolver.hf.space/) with a 100% success rate on 1533 past Wordles
- [Tetris in Assembly](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/Tetris): Tetris game in Assembly for my CSCB58 final project
- [Genshinfy.App](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/genshinfy-app) + [Genshinfy-UwU](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/Genshinfy-UwU): Style Transfer Model to turn yourself into a **Genshin Impact** character. Character repository actively updated every Genshin Impact update
- [UofTearsBot](https://uoftearsbot.vercel.app/): AI therapist because UofT is peak pain and suffering
- [StopSeeker](https://github.com/Raiden-Makoto/stopseeker): Mobile app for real-time TTC Bus Arrivals (API is probably outdated)
